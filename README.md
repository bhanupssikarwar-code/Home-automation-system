# Home-automation-system project 

This project is a complete IoT-based Home Automation System built using the ESP8266 microcontroller. It integrates multiple sensors and actuators to provide monitoring, control, and safety features for a smart home environment.

 Features

Flame & Gas Detection → Alerts for fire or harmful gases using Flame Sensor & MQ2 Sensor.

Motion Detection → PIR Sensor for intrusion detection.

Temperature & Humidity Monitoring → DHT sensor for real-time environmental data.

Distance Measurement → Ultrasonic sensor for smart applications.

Appliance Control → Relay module to control lights, fans, or other home devices.

OLED Display → Displays real-time sensor data.

Buzzer Alerts → Immediate sound alerts for critical conditions.

Web Interface + Blynk App Integration → Remote monitoring and control from anywhere.

 Technologies Used

Hardware: ESP8266, Flame Sensor, MQ2, PIR Sensor, DHT Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, 2-Channel Relay, OLED Display, Buzzer, Breadboard, Jumper Wires.

Software: Arduino IDE (C/C++), HTML, CSS, Python (for backend logic).

Cloud/Remote: Blynk IoT Platform.

 System Overview

The system collects data from sensors, processes it on the ESP8266, and provides control through both a local web server and the Blynk IoT app. Users can monitor conditions like fire, gas leakage, temperature, and motion, and can remotely control connected appliances for convenience and safety.
